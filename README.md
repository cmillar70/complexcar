# Project
In physics class, the cars we have kinda suck. They look ugly, are hard to measure, move at a very weird speed, and are inconsistent. We're making a car that will fix all those problems.

### Requirements
- able to control the velocity on many levels (measurable through initial completion and quantity of options)
- maintain a constant velocity regardless of battery charge (measurable through practical testing)
- reasonable size (measurable by Mr Manning's standards)
- sturdy (measurable through various durability tests)
- easily replaceable battery (measurable by Mr Manning's standards)

### Possible additions for after we're done
- kill switch after a certain distance
- constant acceleration (measurable through initial completion and quantity of options)
- looks cool (measurable by Mr Manning's standards)
- collects data and gives feedback (measurable through initial completion and types of data)

# Timeline
- November 2022: initial plan for wiring and coding
- December 2022: prototype
- February 2023: final plan for wiring and coding
- May 2023: done

## Materials
- acrylic for laser cutting the body (available)
- 3d printing material for the frame (available hopefully)
- 4 60mm micro servo wheels (available)
- 4 TT motors for the wheels (available)
- a dial
- power switch
- probably some other stuff

### Total Budget
less than $500 hopefully

### Results
We plan to build 1 cart initially but document it enough to be able to fully replicate it

## Appearance
8in x 4in x 2in, nothing practical yet, black knight colored
