# Project
In physics class, the cars we have kinda suck, so we're making a better one

### Requirements
- able to control the velocity
- maintain a constant velocity regardless of battery charge
- reasonable size
- sturdy
- easily replaceabe battery

# Timeline
- November 2022: initial plan for wiring and coding
- December 2022: prototype
- February 2023: final plan for wiring and coding
- May 2023: done

### Possible additions for after we're done
- constant acceleration
- looks cool
- collects data and gives feedback

## Materials
- acrylic for laser cutting the body
- wheels
- 4 small motors for the wheels
- a dial
- probably some other stuff

### Budget
less than $500

## Appearance
8in x 4in x 2in, nothing practical yet, black knight colored
