# Project
In physics class, the cars we have only go one speed. What if we made a car that can only go one speed, but instead of that speed being an annoyingly random number and based on the charge of the battery, that speed was a clean integer and based on a dial that you can turn? What if instead of looking kind of boring and weird, it looked sleek and cool? What if instead of being annoying to use, it was made to fit your convenience?

### Requirements
-able to control the velocity
-maintain a constant velocity regardless of battery charge
-reasonable size (about 1/2 a foot long)
-sturdy
-easily replaceabe battery

### Possible additions for after we're done
-constant acceleration
-looks cool
-collects data and gives feedback

## Appearance
rough idea, nothing practical yet, go black knights!
