# Project
In physics class, the cars we have only go one speed. What if we made a car that can only go one speed, but instead of that speed being an annoyingly random number and based on the charge of the battery, that speed was a clean integer and based on a dial that you can turn? What if instead of looking kind of boring and weird, it looked sleek and cool? What if instead of being annoying to use, it was made to fit your convenience?

### Requirements
- able to control the velocity
- maintain a constant velocity regardless of battery charge
- reasonable size
- sturdy
- easily replaceabe battery

# Timeline
- November 2022: initial plan for wiring and coding
- December 2022: prototype
- February 2023: final plan for wiring and coding
- May 2023: done

### Possible additions for after we're done
- constant acceleration
- looks cool
- collects data and gives feedback

## Materials
- acrylic for laser cutting the body
- wheels
- 4 small motors for the wheels
- a dial
- probably some other stuff

### Budget
less than $500

## Appearance
8in x 4in x 2in, nothing practical yet, black knight colored
